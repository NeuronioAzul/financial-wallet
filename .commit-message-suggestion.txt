- Renamed all docs to kebab-case (SETUP.md → setup-guide.md, etc)
- Organized docs into logical folders:
  * architecture/ - Architecture and design docs
  * development/ - Development tools and guides  
  * features/ - Feature-specific documentation
  * guides/ - Long-form tutorials
  * releases/ - Release notes
- Updated all internal links in:
  * README.md
  * docs/README.md
  * docs/api-reference.md
  * backend/README.md
  * frontend/README.md
  * .github/copilot-instructions.md
- Created documentation index files:
  * docs/INDEX.md - Complete file listing
  * DOCUMENTATION.md - Quick reference guide

Files renamed:
- SETUP.md → setup-guide.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md → architecture.md
- API.md → api-reference.md
- O-QUE-FOI-FEITO.md → features/changelog-detalhado.md
- implementation-journey.md → guides/implementation-journey.md
- RELEASE-NOTES-v1.0.0.md → releases/release-notes-v1.0.0.md
+ 8 more files reorganized into subdirectories

All documentation links have been updated. No broken links remain.
